# La Palma Lava Mapping

## Getting started

This notebook was developed in a Microsoft Planetary Computer Jupyter environment.

You should be able to just upload the contents to your own environment on MPC, and run the notebooks - all dependencies should be already in place.

Alternatively, docker images are available (TODO: link).
